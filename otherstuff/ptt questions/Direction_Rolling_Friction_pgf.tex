\part{The direction of rolling friction w/o slippling}

How to determine the direction of friction force acting on a rolling object?
This is important and is ensential to solving the dynamics of rolling
motions.

\begin{case}
Round object freely rolling down the hill\newline
\newline
The only force that makes the object rotate is friction so friction has to
go up the hill. This friction force is exerted on the wheel by the slope.

\input{../../../../Scripts/cordtrans/cases_fig_only/whatever.pgf}
\end{case}

\newpage

\begin{case}
Object is forced to roll up the hill initially but external force is removed
once the object is going upward. We are considering the later part of the
motion when the external force is removed, so only gravitation is in place.
The wheel is still rolling up the hill.\newline
\newline
The rotation of the object slows down as it climbs up the hill. Friction is
the only force that produces a torque to slow down the rotation. So it needs
to go against the rotating direction. So the friction force acting on the
wheel is up the hill.

\input{../../../../Scripts/cordtrans/cases_fig_only/friction2.pgf}
\end{case}

\newpage

\begin{case}
External force $F_{p}$ passing through CM point\newline
\input{../../../../Scripts/cordtrans/cases_fig_only/case3a.pgf}\newline
Friction is still the only force that produces an angular acceleration, so
friction should have the same direction as angular acceleration. If the
object is moving to the right and rotating faster, friction acting on the
object goes towards left. If the object is moving to the left and rotation
slow down because of the external force slowing it down, the friction force
goes towards the left, to produce a torque and a angular acceleration to
slow down the rotation.\newline
\input{../../../../Scripts/cordtrans/cases_fig_only/case3b.pgf}%
\[
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{c}
F_{p}-F_{fr}=ma \\ 
F_{fr}\cdot R=I\alpha =I\frac{a}{R}%
\end{array}%
\right. 
\]
\end{case}

\newpage

\begin{case}
An external torque (not force), like on car tire.\newline
\input{../../../../Scripts/cordtrans/cases_fig_only/case4a.pgf}\newline
In this case, the rule of friction is not to cause rotation; the rotation
about the center is done by the external torque. From 2nd law, in order to
have no slipping, a translational force is needed to accelerate the CM of
the object to move. Otherwise the object will slip. Friction in this case
acts as this \emph{force}, to give the CM of the object an acceleration to
the right. One can judge from the relative movement between the object and
the ground too. Friction prevents the object from skidding at the contact.
So friction acting on the object goes to the right, while the mutual
friction force acting on the ground goes to the left.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\left\{ 
\begin{array}{c}
F_{fr}=ma \\ 
\tau -F_{fr}\cdot R=I\alpha =I\frac{a}{R}%
\end{array}%
\right. \\
&\Rightarrow &a=\frac{\tau }{mR+\frac{I}{R}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
\input{../../../../Scripts/cordtrans/cases_fig_only/case4b.pgf}
\end{case}

\newpage

\begin{case}
External forces not passing through CM pivot. (so there are both external
force and torque.)
\end{case}

\input{../../../../Scripts/cordtrans/cases_fig_only/case5a.pgf}

Let assume friction acting on the wheel goes right, then

\input{../../../../Scripts/cordtrans/cases_fig_only/case5c.pgf}

from 2nd law%
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\left\{ 
\begin{array}{c}
F_{p}+F_{fr}=ma \\ 
\left( F_{p}-F_{fr}\right) R=I\alpha =I\frac{a}{R}%
\end{array}%
\right. \\
&\Rightarrow &F_{fr}=\frac{1}{2}\left( m-\frac{I}{R^{2}}\right) a
\end{eqnarray*}

So if $mR^{2}>I$, then $F_{fr}$ goes to the right!

\bigskip

If frction acting on the wheel goes to the left,

\input{../../../../Scripts/cordtrans/cases_fig_only/case5b.pgf}

\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\left\{ 
\begin{array}{c}
F_{p}-F_{fr}=ma \\ 
\left( F_{p}+F_{fr}\right) R=I\alpha =I\frac{a}{R}%
\end{array}%
\right. \\
&\Rightarrow &F_{fr}=\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{I}{R^{2}}-m\right) a
\end{eqnarray*}

So if $mR^{2}<I$, then $F_{fr}$ goes to the left!

\bigskip

%TCIMACRO{\TeXButton{end2columns}{\end{multicols}}}%
%BeginExpansion
\end{multicols}%
%EndExpansion

\bigskip

In this case the direction of friction depends on the condition $mR^{2}>I$
or $mR^{2}<I$. We can also recgonize in the first senario if $mR^{2}<I$ then 
$F_{fr}$ is negative, so the friction should be opposite to the positive
direction we assume (to the right). This way we can save the time of working
on the 2nd case.
